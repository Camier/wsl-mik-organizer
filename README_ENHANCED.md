- **MEDIA-WORK**: Video/audio processing and creative tools
- **DEV-TOOLS**: Development utilities and frameworks
- **PROJECTS**: General projects and applications
- **RESOURCES**: Configuration files, documentation, data
- **_UNSORTED**: Uncategorized files

## üìä Usage Examples

```bash
# Use all CPU cores with dashboard
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --dashboard

# Custom worker count for constrained systems
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --workers 4 --batch-size 50

# Dry run to preview changes
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --dry-run --workers 8

# Resume interrupted organization
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --resume

# Test classification logic
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --test
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Variables

```bash
export MAX_WORKERS=8        # Number of worker processes
export BATCH_SIZE=100       # Files per batch
export WORKER_TIMEOUT=300   # Timeout per worker (seconds)
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Multi-Worker Architecture
- Named pipe communication between workers
- Graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- Per-worker performance tracking
- Conflict resolution with unique file naming

### Smart Load Balancing
- Dynamic worker assignment based on performance
- Real-time load monitoring and rebalancing
- Worker health tracking with error rates

### Memory Management
- Pattern matching cache with LRU eviction
- Memory usage monitoring
- Automatic cache clearing on high memory usage

### State Management
- Checkpoint system saves progress every 100 files
- Resume capability for interrupted operations
- JSON state persistence with worker statistics

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live progress tracking with ETA calculation
- Performance dashboard with worker status
- Memory usage and cache hit rate monitoring

## üìà Performance Comparison

| Feature | Original | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Processing Speed | Single-threaded | 8-16x faster (multi-core) |
| Memory Usage | Linear growth | Optimized with caching |
| Fault Tolerance | None | Resume from checkpoints |
| Monitoring | Basic progress | Real-time dashboard |
| Load Balancing | None | Adaptive distribution |

## üß™ Classification Testing

The enhanced script includes comprehensive pattern testing:

```bash
./organize_mik_enhanced.sh --test
```
